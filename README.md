# KitchenQuest

KitchenQuest was our final group project of Code Fellows iOS Accelerator. KitchenQuest takes the ingredients you have in your kitchen and gives you recipes based off those ingredients.

Some of the things learned was using CoreData, restful api requests to Spoonacular (API we used), UISegmented Control, and WKWebView.
